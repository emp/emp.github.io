          <p>Using out of the box features for configuration, a custom frontend was built to give the application a look removed
            from the platform's traditional publishing pages.</p>
          <p>The migration of the entire existing catalog was automated and the application allows fine grained download access

          <p>So many intranets in a box, but what happens when the client wants it all custom? With a pure client-side frontend
            solution, this project was able to keep their existing platform free from .NET customizations making their migration
            path in the future a breeze.</p>
          <p>The goal was to discontinue use of Level CMS where several custom applications and integrations were running. By
            moving these integrations to different SharePoint features such as
            <span class="tag">BCS</span>,
            <span class="tag">User Profiles</span> and

        <p>The biggest in its market, this 2000 employee client wanted a fresh, modern and quick to go live intranet. After
          being stuck two years with a project that never went live.</p>

        <p>The mood became even more reserved when I decided to do a full rewrite without reusing any of the existing solution,
          but quickly turned around when the biggest piece of the project was demoed on week 3 of the delivery phase. It
          was definetely not the easy path (full rewrite) but the most rewarding one.</p>
        <p>The quick turnaround made most departments to call for a series of new features, which are still being added months
          after the original project was completed, from migrating old apps to the new platform to creating new solutions
          that helped their teams to work better together</p>
